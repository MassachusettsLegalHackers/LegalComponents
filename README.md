# LegalComponents

Excerpt of note on potential collaborative project with prospective Florida Legal Hackers and off-duty Massachusetts Legal Hackers:

"...what if we dedicated a one-night Massachusetts Legal Hackers session to develop small part of what we discussed (a workable approach to chunk reusable content blocks for legal instruments using standard web components (and leaning on "cards" with some "tag" and "label" metadata) for purposes of a handful of standard legal instrument "HTML template" types (pleadings, contracts, authorizations/delegations of authority and maybe a generic consumer legal notice or safety disclosure).  I think with their existing micro-service architecture and material design/polymer based display layer this would be a piece of cake. Also, I've already mocked up some good starting points with standard legal documents (creative commons licenses, mortgage loan disclosures, DCMA counter-claim notices, etc). 

Assuming I'm correct, then one of the fun take-away items from this would be a shared basic design approach and a starting point to add a next-generation "signature block" using the Blockchain-backed public key and hash method.  

This would also be a good hack to start together in person that open the door for longer term collaboration remotely and could provide a basis for connecting in the future on innovative models and methods for doing meta-data based analytics on legal content in a way their company would have a natural advantage for a long time yet also honestly be able to say they are doing a straight up open standards based "clean architecture" that any modern company, app and service could benefit from adopting and at a high level could also interoperate with (especially for industry standard content or legally required content or "best practice" content, etc). 

Last thing - I believe this could also be a good basis for the team to start a new chapter of Legal Hackers as a way to build community and advance their ideas on future of law (Florida Legal Hackers is not yet "a thing" I noticed: https://legalhackers.org/people). So... that's another cool potential downstream outcome..."
